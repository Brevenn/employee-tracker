# **Want to Track your Workers? Here's an APP for you!**

#

## *Description:*

**Want an easy app to track your employees? Well in this repository I have created an application using a SQL database to manage employees, departments and roles. I've also added a little flare by replacing the employee data with One Piece Characters!(For my Anime fans out there) and the application is fully functioning so navigating through the prompts should be a breeze!**

#

### *USER STORY:*

* **AS A** business owner
* **I WANT** to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company,
* **SO THAT** I can organize and plan my business.

#

### **Usage:**

#### *Installation and Requirements to Begin:*

* The User will navigate to the file explorer and open the integrated terminal.
* In the command-line the user will run `npm i` to install the necessary packages and dependencies.
* The user will follow with `npm start` to begin the SQL based application.

#### *Prompts:*

The following prompts will appear when the user begins the application:

* `Add New Department Type`
* `Add New Department Role`
* `Add New Department`
* `View all Department Types`
* `View all Department Roles`
